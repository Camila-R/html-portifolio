    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p style="padding: 20px; line-height: 1.5rem;">Let’s talk about me! Well. I’m a proactive person and determined. <br>
        I’m always looking for professional improvement and, because of that, I'm always studying and learning. <br>
        I’ve an adventurous spirit and I don't like to be accommodated. I’m not afraid of new challenges and taking risks. <br>
        I’m a little nerd and I like to travel, nature and love animals. <br>
        After I've worked as a lawyer, My first opportunity to be in technology’s world, my passion, was a customer success. And it was the beginning of my journey. <br>
        Later, I've had the opportunity to work as a Product Owner and I can say that I am discovering myself as a professional.
